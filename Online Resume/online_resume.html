                            <p>I was thrilled experiencing this internship and I am happy being a part of this company I got accepted. I was having a hard time finding a good company only to be given a good one. My internship experience was an eye opening, thrilling, tiring, happy experience. Though there are mishaps and uncooperative situations that we just had to bear with, I can say it was an okay experience because I was able to enjoy it. I learned a lot of things in spending my summer in this internship and I am thinking of continuing to work since I am getting used to waking up in 7:30 in the morning, working and waiting till the clock hits 5:00 then I can finally rest. Itâ€™s like part of an adulting process and I just realized that internship did not only bring me exposure to the real field of my chosen career. It also exposed me to many different things such as the real world of maturity. </p>
